# Amulet Project
Final project for COMP B12. It's a three step C++ game, using most of the concepts we learned in the class. The class was mainly about the concepts and methodology of C++. 

This is my first upload on github, so I'm not sure if the formatting of this project is great. Regardless, the source code and all of the info is in the Document pdf attached. The slideshow was part of the submission. Unfortunately, the demonstration video is too large, but it is pretty straightforward. It simply shows how the game works and how a user would navigate through it. It should all be mostly intuitive through the document, nothing advanced was used.
